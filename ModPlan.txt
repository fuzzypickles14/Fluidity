Fluids
	- all fluids are crafted my mixing Mystic Water with the necessary compound
	- have 4 states: inert, active, activating, not active 
		- inert: fluids passive and active abilities do nothing
		- active: fluids passive and active abilities do something
		- activating: fluid is being activated either from Mystic Water or from its inert state. from inert takes quicker. some fluids cause effects when activating
	- the more complex the compound the more complex the fluid mechanics
	- fluids expend some of their Water Energy during their passive and acitve rate
	- when all water energy is expended, the fluid becomes inert and is as useful as water
	
	
Activators:
	- items that can activate fluid active effects, begin fountain crafts, and everything else
	- multiple tiers that hold different levels of water energy
	- can be filled with water in any way but needs ALOT to be used in different things (activating a fluid should take somewhere between 4 and 6 buckets of water)
	- crafted with prismarine, and guardian drops
	
	
Fountains:
	- crafting system

Well:
	- way for fluids to not expend energy
	
Glyphs:
